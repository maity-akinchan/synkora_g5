PWA Icon Requirements
=====================

You need to create the following icon files:

1. icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

These should be your Synkora logo with:
- Transparent or solid background
- Square format
- PNG format
- High quality

Quick ways to create them:
- Use an online tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Use Figma/Photoshop to export at these sizes
- Use an AI tool to generate a logo

Recommended design:
- Use the neon green (#22c55e) theme color
- Simple, recognizable icon
- Works well at small sizes

Once created, place them in the /public folder and delete this guide file.
